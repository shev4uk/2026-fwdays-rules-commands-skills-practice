# Product Requirements Document - Workshop Slides

## 1. Purpose
Create a concise, workshop-ready slide deck that teaches intermediate practitioners how to effectively apply **rules, commands, and skills** in real-world scenarios. The deck should be suitable for a live workshop format with limited time for deep theory, emphasizing practical takeaways.

## 2. Goals
- Deliver a structured learning path from concepts → patterns → practice
- Provide actionable guidance that participants can apply immediately
- Support live facilitation with clear pacing and engagement points

## 3. Target Audience
- **Intermediate practitioners** who already understand the basics and want to level up their execution and decision-making

## 4. Scope

### In Scope
- Slide deck covering:
  - Core concepts and mental models
  - Patterns, pitfalls, and best practices
  - Case-based application
  - Interactive exercise prompts

### Out of Scope
- Full course materials (handouts, code labs, or homework)
- Beginner-level introductions or advanced research deep-dives

## 5. Content Requirements
- **Core framing**: Define "rules," "commands," and "skills" clearly and show how they connect
- **Practical application**: At least 2-3 real-world scenarios
- **Comparison/decision-making**: When to use which approach and why
- **Common mistakes**: Typical failure modes and how to avoid them
- **Exercises**: 2-3 short, guided prompts for group or solo reflection

## 6. Functional Requirements (Slides)
- Clear slide flow (setup → model → examples → practice → recap)
- Slide titles are action-oriented and explain the "why"
- Content supports a **live talk** (not a self-study doc)
- Minimal dense text; use visual cues, diagrams, and short bullets

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Consistent visual style across slides
- Slide count supports ~45-60 minute workshop (including exercises)

## 8. Proposed Outline (Draft)
1. Workshop goals & agenda
2. The triad: Rules vs Commands vs Skills
3. Why the distinction matters (decision impact)
4. Mapping problems to the right tool
5. Practical pattern #1 + example
6. Practical pattern #2 + example
7. Common pitfalls
8. Exercise #1
9. Exercise #2
10. Recap + takeaways

## 9. Success Metrics
- Participants can explain the differences in their own words
- Participants can choose an appropriate approach for a scenario
- Workshop feedback indicates clarity and applicability

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Slides become too theoretical
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize examples and exercises
- **Risk**: Audience range is too wide
  - **Mitigation**: Include optional "deep dive" callouts

## 11. Open Questions / Assumptions
- Assumption: Workshop length is ~45-60 minutes
- Assumption: Delivery is live with facilitator
- If this differs, I can adjust pacing and slide count accordingly
