- Primary deliverable is the Slidev workshop deck under `slidev/`.
- Use `docs/PRD.md` as the source of truth for scope, goals, and audience.
- Keep edits minimal and focused; do not reformat unrelated content.
- Avoid touching `slidev/package-lock.json` unless dependencies change.
- Preserve existing tone and formatting conventions in files you edit.
