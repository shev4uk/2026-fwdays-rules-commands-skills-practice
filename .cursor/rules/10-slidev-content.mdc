description: Slidev markdown rules
globs:
  - slidev/**/*.md
---
- Maintain Slidev slide separators with `---` between slides.
- Keep per-slide frontmatter minimal and only when needed.
- Use short, scannable bullets; avoid dense paragraphs.
- Use speaker notes in the final HTML comment block of a slide when needed.
- When referencing code, prefer `slidev/snippets` and `<<< @/snippets/...` embeds.
- Preserve `mdc: true` in the main frontmatter unless explicitly changing syntax mode.
