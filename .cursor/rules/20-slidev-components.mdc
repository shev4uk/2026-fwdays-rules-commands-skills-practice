description: Slidev components and snippets rules
globs:
  - slidev/components/**/*.vue
  - slidev/snippets/**/*.{ts,js,vue}
---
- Prefer `script setup` in Vue components and keep them presentation-focused.
- Keep components small and reusable; avoid global side effects.
- For snippets, keep examples self-contained and aligned with slide narratives.
- Use TypeScript in snippets when possible for clarity and correctness.
